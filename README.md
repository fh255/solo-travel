# Solo Travel - Traveling Blog

This is my fourth milestone project with Code Institute. Solo Travel is a Django-based blog application designed for travel enthusiasts, especially those who love exploring Switzerland.

The site allows users to share their travel stories, upload photos from their journeys, and interact with other posts by commenting, liking, and disliking the liked comments.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals:
The main objective of this project is to develop a travel blog that offers full CRUD functionality for registered users. This allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their own blog posts and comments directly on the site, without any delays or intermediaries. Users will have complete control over their content, with all changes being immediately reflected on the site.

### Strategy:
An Agile methodology was employed to plan and execute this project. The project management was facilitated through a Kanban board on GitHub Projects, where tasks were organized into three main columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done. This structure ensured a clear visual representation of the project workflow and helped maintain focus on task progression and completion.

To achieve the project goals, the work was divided into 16 distinct parts, each representing a significant component or feature. These parts were tracked through the Kanban board, allowing for efficient prioritization and management of tasks.

The tasks within the project were categorized using labels to indicate their priority and progress status. The labels and their distribution among the tasks were as follows:

  - To Do: Tasks that are yet to be started.
  - In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on.
  - Done: Tasks that have been completed.
