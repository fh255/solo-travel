# Solo Travel - Traveling Blog

This is my fourth milestone project with Code Institute. Solo Travel is a Django-based blog application designed for travel enthusiasts, especially those who love exploring Switzerland.

The site allows users to share their travel stories, upload photos from their journeys, and interact with other posts by commenting, liking, and disliking the liked comments.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals:
The primary goal for this project is to create a fly fishing blog, that enables full CRUD functionality to register users so that they can Create, Read, Update and Delete both blog posts and comments directly on the site without any delays or intermediaries. The user should have full control over their own posts and that any changes made on the site are directly reflected to the user.

### Strategy:
An Agile methodology was used to plan this project. This was implemented using a Kanban board in GitHub Project with linked Issues. To cover the goals of this project, a total of 5 Epics where created, which were then further developed into 32 User Stories, each with their own acceptance criterias and tasks to complete. Labels where then used to prioritize the importance of each User Story. 28 User Stories were completed working on this project.

The following labels were used in this project and the distribution of user stories by label are:

  - Must-Have: 16/32
  - Should-Have: 7/32
  - Could-Have: 8/32
  - Probably-Won’t-Have: 1/32
